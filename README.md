# Attrition_predition_IBM

Implementation of Machine Learning &  Data Analytics for HR Management

The goal of this project is to predict whether an employee will leave the company or not (`Attrition` column, binary classification).
* The dataset is artificially generated, but it is based on real data: [original data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
    * Perform analysis, experiments and model selection on the training set. Don't touch the test set until you're ready to submit your predictions.
    * Save some data from the training set to use as a validation set. Do not use the test set for this purpose.
    * Once you're comfortable with the performance of your model on the training set, use the test set to get a final estimate of the performance of your model.
    * The result most contain the predictions of your model on the test set. This means that the CSV should contain as many rows as the test set, and a single column with the predictions (0 or 1).
 
    * This project was performed by Dynamite Consulting
